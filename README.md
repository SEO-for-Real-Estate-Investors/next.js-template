# next.js-template

## need to write about how to use/what has been done to initialize:

- Commitizen/Standard Version/the release and commit scripts to maintain proper versioning
- Supabase
- next-iron-session (withSession)
- SWR
- React Hook Form + @hookform/resolvers package w/ Vest validation library
- Jotai for state management
- Chakra UI

## eventually, use a github readme template like [this one](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template)
